## Overview

So, as you know, I'm Thadeu, a passionate Ruby Developer.

Always had desire get a blog. I think that every developer needs expose a little bit about yourself, and, also about your activities, career, learning and everything for regarding.

Today, have a blog, its free, really, this blog is 100% free.

## Career

I started my career as developer in the 2007. When I decided learning about Web Design. It was good moment for me. Every company needs a Web Design.

Who is man that make the layout on Photoshhop, cut and then create HTML and CSS? It was so cool and challenged.

## Frontend Developer

Just knowing HTML and CSS wasnt enough, the web was going to lighting. Then I started to learn JavaScript. As a good junior developer, logic, algoritm and data structure is not important. I just know make things with JavaScript. Kind of show and hide elements, animate everything in the page.

I made a bunch of courses, in the last wasnt Youtube, so I used books, DVDs and presencial courses.

I learned a lot, and was natural start to learn about logic, algoritm and data structure. In the time, I was already flighing as developer, I felt the Man. I knew HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Serioulys, I made a lot of simple websites to any clients, as bakery, grocey and more.

After some years working as freelancer, I get the change in my life.

## Backend Developer

I felt good enough, to try some positions around on my city. I didn't degree, I didn't technical course. But I did know enough to create any website.

So, I got job as frontend in the company. Great! I was my time to flight. This job made me work 8 hours per day, Monday to Friday to earn up almost nothing in cash.

I was a difficult time in my life. But was for good to earn knowledge and know others developers. So in the company, they works with PHP and MySQL, they using frameworks like CodeIgniter, Zend and Symfony2. Naturally, I effort to learn PHP and all frameworks as possible.

And it was that I started my career as backend developer. After any years I was already working as backend, resolving Issues and PRs that another developer couldn't.

## Ruby Developer

In this time, I was already almost 5 yeas as developer, working with frontend(HTML, CSS, JS), backend(PHP), CS, CX and IT Support. Wow! So was happy.. Where Ruby showing in my life?

There was a workshop in my city, they talking about a new technologies, they speaking about Flask, Djanjo, Spring, etc.. Sooooo, there was a blessing developer that speaks about Ruby on Rails. I thougth it was fantastic.

A new framework could resolve any problems that I had in my day. Sprockets, scaffolding, tasks, console sandbox, easy deploy and more. The thinks that those PHP frameworks didnt have.

So, I did think, I'll chance my focus to learn Ruby. I made any courses to understand it. I was staying each more interested, because every day I did learn every thing.

Since, my focus always was Ruby and Rails, every company I worked for was like Ruby on Rails.

## Today

Well, currently I like say that I'm consider a Senior Developer. After +10 years working as developer, I think that I passed for 80% the problems found in the life of developer. I still learn about ruby, rails, js, reading books and get the new certifications.

This was a part of my life and my career as developer. In another time, I'll make a new post about another part of my life, my family as well. If you like read until here, thank you and see you soon in the next post. Bye!
